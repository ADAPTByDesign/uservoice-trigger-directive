uservoice-trigger-directive
===========================

Simple directive to trigger a UserVoice widget. Requires UserVoice widget to be included.

#### Install with Bower:

```
bower install uservoice-trigger-directive
```

#### Include the directive in your Angular module:

```
var myApp = angular.module('myApp', ['uservoice-trigger-directive']);
```

## Usage

Use the `uservoice-trigger` directive attribute on the element you want to trigger the UserVoice widget on click. You also have to set the `mode` attribute to one of `contact`, `smartvote` or `satisfaction` (see [UserVoice docs](https://developer.uservoice.com/docs/widgets/overview/) for more information on the widget options). Remember to have the `UserVoice` widget included already.

```html
<a uservoice-trigger mode="contact">Contact</div>
```
